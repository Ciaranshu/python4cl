# Python 4 computational linguists 

An Introductory Python course for Computational Lingustics

## Configuration

For this project we will use Python 3.6. 
The project structure is:

```
.
├── CONTRIBUTING.md
├── module_1
│   ├── module_1.1
...
│   └── module_1.4
├── module_2
├── module_3
├── module_3
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt

```

You should look into the folders `module_x`. Each module is divided in many submodules, and each `module_x.y folder` contains the the Jupyter notebooks you will run during the course. 
The other files you see here are:
- `README.md` is the present file;
- `requirements.txt` contains all the Python libraries required to run the code; you will use this file when installing Python on your machine;
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` is a file containing the guidelines we used write this course. You can peek into it if you want to write beautiful Python code!
