    "\n",
    "Welcome everyone! This Jupyter Notebook that you're looking at right now is part of the **Python for Computational Linguists lab** which is specially designed to accompany the Li18 Computational Linguistics course in the School of Arts and Humanities at the University of Cambridge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python practical is aimed at those new to programming and provides an introduction to **Python version 3.6** with a focus specifically on Natural Language Processing (NLP). By the end of this course, you should feel confident to write simple Python programs for a variety of purposes and understand more complex Python programs written by others.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why study Python programming?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Good question! The short answer is that Python is a great practical skill if you want to work with data to answer linguistic questions (corpus linguistics) or build models that can analyse, process and generate text (NLP). Learning programming also helps you develop problem solving skills which are very transferable.\n",
    "\n",
    "And here's the long answer ...\n",
    "\n",
    "* Computational Linguistics is a broad and intellectually demanding subject that draws on several academic disciplines but at its core it is also essentially a practical subject. We believe that part of the training to become a great Computational Linguist should be to become confident in applying NLP methods to gain real insights from real corpus data. Our aim in this these Python labs ('PyCompLing') is to give you a gentle introduction to Python 3 programming that is *custom-made* for Computational Linguists. If your interest at the moment is more on the theory (we hope you'll soon get hooked on programming!) then you can think that the skills you learn in the Python classes will provide a functional context for the concepts you are studying in the lectures. And if you wish to pursue the subject further then the skills you learn here should equip you for more advanced study, e.g. in a 3rd year project or in MPhil research.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Python 3 is one of the most widely taught programming languages at universities. But why the popularity? Essentially Python is fairly easy to learn and comes with a powerful set of libraries that allow you to quickly get up and running with your own NLP tasks and applications. Or in other words you can draw on a wide body of pre-built programs that others have already built so you don't have to re-invent the wheel! \n",
    "\n",
    "* Programming languages like Python tend to be glue-like, good at linking together assorted software libraries ('libraries'). Quite soon you'll start hearing about some libraries with names like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * *spaCy*: a high performance NLP toolkit\n",
    "    * *NLTK*: the NLP Toolkit ([there's a book](http://www.nltk.org/book/))\n",
    "    * *scikit-learn*: machine learning\n",
    "    * *gensim*: topic modeling \n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries are what enables Python code to be so concise and expressive, and also fast at working with large amounts of data. It means you need to know your way around some big libraries, so you don't spend all your time endlessly rewriting code that others have already made available.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Finally, Python also offers lots of support to programmers with a huge following in forums such as StackOverFlow (https://stackoverflow.com/) and CodeAcademy (https://www.codecademy.com/). If you've got a question about Python the chances are that somebody in one of these forums has already provided an answer!\n"

    "\n",
    "Unlike the lectures where we will focus on fundamental techniques, PyCompLing will emphasize the use of practical hands-on skills for solving NLP problems. By the end of Module 2 you should be well along the road to building your own text processing pipelines using open source Python libraries like spaCy and NLTK.\n"

To balance for the increased workload the number of theory-led assignments will be reduced. In 2021 what will change is that you will also receive Python assignments in the PyCompLing labs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* At various points within each Module there will be a variety of formative assessments with hidden answers that you can reveal to allow you to find out what you know. In this way you can better focus your own learning. You should aim to answer all the questions. Remember that the formative assessments are for your information - they will not count towards your grade on the module.\n",

The expectation is that SAQs should be completable within the 2 hour laboratory session. However don't worry if you can't complete the work within the lab time, SAQs can be completed away from the lab, e.g. on a Chromebook in the MML library. SAQs are checked in person at a sign-up session by Teaching Assistants (TAs) in the fourth week of each module (e.g Weeks 4 and 8 in Michaelmas term). At the sign-up session TAs will choose some parts of the SAQs and ask you to explain your answers. The grading session is for the examiners to guard against plagiarism. ** Please do not search for or view solutions to the SAQs on the Web or share SAQ solutions with friends**. At the sign-up session you should have your notebooks ready and open in a browser, and your code should execute without errors.  You may also be called on by the course coordinator to explain your answer so we can verify its originality. \n",
