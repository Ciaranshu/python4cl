    "  <p>The correct answer is B - Naive Bayes assumes that the probability of finding a certain word is independent from the probability of finding another word. So, for example, in the domain of movie reviews, it assumes that the probabilities of finding the words <code>Indiana</code> and <code>Jones</code> are not correlated, even if in practice we know that this is not the case.</p>\n",
